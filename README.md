# Battleship game

This is a simple battleship game which runs in command prompt. It was assigned to me as a project on my college class Programming 2 on my first year.

## Running the game

Windows:
- If you have installed Visual Studio on your computer, open the Start menu and choose Developer Command Prompt for VS2015
- Position yourself in the directory where you saved the .c file using command cd
- Type cl main.c to compile the program
- If everything went well type main to run the program
- Thats it :)

Linux:
- Open terminal
- Position yourself in the directory where you saved the .c file using command cd
- Type gcc -o main main.c to compile the program
- If everything went well type ./main to run the program
- Thats it :)
